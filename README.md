# gatsby-starter-kitt
The Gatsby starter with `typescript`, `eslint`, `prettier`, `stylelint`,
`styled-components`, `styled-system` and `mdx`. Mostly created for my own
personal needs.

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby
documentation - Building with
Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).
